- The number of new subscribers registered in 2016 was 326. In 2017, the number of new subscribers increased significantly to 43,708, and in 2018, there was a further increase to 52,062. This shows that the company managed to attract more and more new customers every year, indicating a positive growth in its customer base.
- The average number of active monthly users in 2016 was 108, which increased to 3,694 in 2017, and then to 5,338 in 2018. This increase shows that more customers are actively involved in using the company's services every year. This could be an indication that the company managed to keep customers interested and engaged after they signed up.
- Order frequency ratio in 2016 was 1.009, while in 2017 it increased to 1.031, and in 2018 to 1.023. This order frequency ratio shows how many times an average customer makes an order in a certain period of time. Although the differences are small between the years, this ratio indicates that customers tend to place orders consistently over time.
- In 2016, the average customer placed three reorders after their first order. In 2017, this figure had increased to 1,256, and in 2018 it had fallen to 1,167. Despite fluctuations in the number of repeat orders from year to year, these figures suggest that most customers tend to place orders more than once, which can be considered a good indicator of customer retention.

## Assets/Total Revenue and Cancel Orders Every Year
<img src="https://github.com/JodhiKrisantus/Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL/blob/master/Assets/Annual%20Product%20Category%20Quality.png">

- In 2016, the product category that contributed to the highest revenue was "furniture decor". The product that was most canceled in orders was "toys". This shows that the business has good potential in selling decorative furniture, which is a major factor in increasing revenue
- In 2017, the product category that generated the most revenue was "bed bath table" (bedding, bathroom, table) while the product category that experienced the most cancellations of orders was "sports leisure" (sports and recreation).
- In 2018, the product category that generated the most revenue was "health beauty" (health and beauty), while the product category that experienced the most order cancellations was "health beauty". This shows that sales of health and beauty products have succeeded in increasing revenue.
- In the Toys, sports leisure, health beauty product categories, the order cancellation rates were the highest. A high number of order cancellations in the same product category indicates a problem that needs to be addressed in terms of stock management, product quality or customer service.

## Total Revenue and Cancel Orders Every Year
<img src="https://github.com/JodhiKrisantus/Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL/blob/master/Assets/Total%20Revenue%20and%20Cancel%20Orders%20Every%20Year.png">

- In 2016, the ecommerce company's revenue was $46,653.74, with a total of 26 canceled orders. This may indicate that the business is still in its infancy or may be experiencing challenges in terms of growing and managing orders.
- In 2017, the company's revenue increased significantly to $6,921,776.32. During this period, there were 265 canceled orders. While the increase in revenue can be considered a positive result, the high order cancellation rate is a cause for concern.
- In the end, the company's revenue in 2018 reached $8,451,584.77. Even though this figure represents a significant increase compared to initial revenue, there were still 334 canceled orders.
- This relatively high annual increase in cancellation rate can affect a company's financial performance and indicates a problem that needs to be addressed, such as logistical problems, customer dissatisfaction, or other problems that can lead to order cancellations. Maybe the company needs to pay attention to the factors that cause the high order cancellation rate to optimize the sales process.

## Total usage of payment type per year

- The graph illustrates the tendency or trend that customers tend to prefer using credit cards as their payment method during that period. This can show that credit cards have become a popular and reliable choice for customers to make purchases or transactions in e-commerce
- Apart from credit cards, payment methods that are quite popular on the e-commerce platform are "Boleto" and "Voucher." Although not as much as using a credit card, these two payment methods are still significant choices for customers in completing transactions on the platform.
- This data can be valuable information for e-commerce platforms to optimize payment processes and improve customer experience. They can continue to provide popular payment services such as credit cards and consider ways to increase the adoption of other payment methods such as debit cards by improving their security and convenience. Increasing offers, promotions or incentives to use certain payment methods can also be a strategy to drive adoption and increase market share.
